My first AddOn for retail WoW. 

Almost Completed Achievements creates a new panel next to the Achievements UI.  When Achievements is opened for the first time each session, ACA will scan for achievements which are at a certain percentage threshold towards completion. By default this is 80%, but can be modified by a slider.

I haven't coded in 20 years, so I'm sure it's not ideal, but I'm learning as I go.
